#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
NoteApp is a web application built in HTML, vanilla CSS and JavaScript for the front end, and Flask and SQL for the back end. 

The idea was born by researching for inspirational project which would be not only challenging, but would result in practical and useful tools to use in my everyday life.

The application is structured with an initial registration and login method. Each user will be able to see only their own notes, and make any modifications on them.

Notes can be created, archived, and deleted. After a note is archived, it can be restored, but if it's deleted, it cannot be restored. Text editing features are added in through buttons, such as making text bold, italicized, striked-through and unerlined.

The application is responsive and can be used on any device.
